### Background
System for a movie reservation service as describe in roadmap.sh project: https://roadmap.sh/projects/movie-reservation-system

### Goal
The goal of this project is to help you understand how to implement complex business logic i.e. seat reservation and scheduling, thinking about the data model and relationships, and complex queries.

### Requirements
We have intentionally left out the implementation details to encourage you to think about the design and implementation of the system. However here are some requirements that you can consider:

#### User Authentication and Authorization
1. Users should be able to sign up and log in.
2. You also need roles for users, such as admin and regular user. Admins should be able to manage movies and showtimes.
3. Regular users should be able to reserve seats for a showtime.
